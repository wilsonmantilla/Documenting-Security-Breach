<h1>Incident Handler's Journal Entry</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I was presented with a scenario involving a security incident at a Health Care Clinic, stemming from a phishing attack. My assignment involved documenting the findings in a structured format. This project was part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification.


<h2>Scenario</h2>

- A small U.S. health care clinic experienced a security incident on Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. which severely disrupted their business operations.
- The cause of the security incident was a phishing email that contained a malicious attachment. Once it was downloaded, ransomware was deployed encrypting the organization's computer files.
- An organized group of unethical hackers left a ransom note stating that the company's files were encrypted and demanded money in exchange for the decryption key

Description: Documenting cyber security breach

- Who: An organized group of unethical hackers
- What: A ransomware security incident
- Where: Health Care Company
- When: Tuesday, 9:00am
- Why: The hackers accessed the company's systems through a phishing attack. Once they got in, they put their ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting important files. The intent appears to be financial due to the ransom note demanding a large sum of money to decrypt the files.

<h2>Additinal Notes</h2>

- The health care clinic can implement solutions such as employee training agaisnt phishing attacks and email filters to try to prevent this incident from happening again.
- Can these files be restored without having to pay ransom?
